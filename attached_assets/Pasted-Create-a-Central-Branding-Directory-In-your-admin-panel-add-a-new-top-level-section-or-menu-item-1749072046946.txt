Create a Central “Branding” Directory

In your admin panel, add a new top‐level section or menu item called “Branding & Templates.”

Inside that section, set up four subfolders (or tabs):

Styles – PDF guidelines (colors, typography, logos).

Templates – PowerPoint slides, email HTML, social‐media templates.

Governance – policy documents, approval workflows, request forms.

Assets – raw SVG/PNG icons, font files, mockup images.

Design a Simple Navigation Interface

Display four tabs or cards labeled Styles, Templates, Governance, and Assets.

When a user clicks a tab, show a list of files in that category.

Include a brief description or date next to each file so people know what it is and when it was last updated.

Implement File Listings with Download and Preview

For each file, show:

An icon indicating the file type (PDF, PPTX, HTML, SVG).

The file name and a short description.

The date of last update.

A “Preview” button (for PDFs or images) and a “Download” link.

If possible, embed a lightweight PDF viewer so users can skim before downloading.

Add an “Upload New Document” Workflow

Only permitted roles (e.g., Marketing or Branding Admin) should see an “Upload New” button.

The upload form must ask for:

Category (Styles, Templates, Governance, or Assets)

File name (or auto‐fill from the uploaded filename)

Brief description (e.g., “Color palette guidelines” or “2025 email template”)

Version label (e.g., “v20250615”)

The file itself

After upload, automatically place the file into its correct subfolder and update the listing.

Maintain Version History

Whenever a file is re‐uploaded under the same name or ID, keep the previous version in an “archive” subfolder.

Show a “View older versions” link for each document, listing past iterations and their dates.

Encourage clear naming like “template‐email_v2.html” so it’s obvious which version is current.

Implement Role‐Based Access Control

Define two roles:

Branding Admin – can upload, edit, and delete files.

General User – can only view, preview, and download.

Before rendering upload or delete buttons, check the user’s role on the server side.

Offer Search and Filter Capabilities

Add a search box that filters files by name or keyword.

Provide quick filters or dropdowns so users can show only PDFs, or only PowerPoint templates, etc.

Allow filtering by category (Styles, Templates, Governance, Assets).

Organize Content Within Each Category

Styles folder:

Color palette PDF

Typography guidelines PDF

Logo package ZIP (SVG + PNG)

Templates folder subdivided further:

Presentations (SlideDeck.potx)

Emails (email_template.html, with a preview image)

Social (1080×1080 PSD and 1080×1920 PSD)

Signature (HTML + preview PNG)

Governance folder:

Brand usage policy PDF

Approval workflow PDF

Request form PDF or link to online form

Assets folder:

Icons (icon_secops.svg, icon_infraops.svg, etc.)

Fonts (Montserrat .woff/.woff2) if you want to provide offline versions

Example mockup screenshots

Add Brief Document Descriptions

Below each file name, include one or two lines describing its purpose. For example:

“guideline‐colors.pdf – primary and neutral color codes for all digital materials.”

“SlideDeck_ness_v1.potx – official slide template for internal and client presentations.”

Set Up Approval and Review Workflow

Whenever someone uploads or updates a file, send a notification to the Branding Admin group for approval.

After approval, automatically mark the file as “Official.”

Keep a changelog entry (date, uploader’s name, and summary of changes) for transparency.

Provide Download Buttons and Previews

For PDFs: embed a thumbnail preview or use a modal window so users can glance before downloading.

For PowerPoint and Photoshop files: show a static preview image or thumbnail and then link to download.

Document the Process in a README or Help Section

On the same admin page, include a short “How to use this section” guide that explains:

How to upload a new document.

How to check version history.

Where to find the style guide.

Who to contact for questions.

Test and Roll Out

Verify that users with “viewer” permissions cannot upload or delete.

Test uploading a new style PDF, replacing it, and confirming that the old version moves to “archive.”

Ensure that the search and filters work correctly across all categories.

Once everything is stable, announce to the team where to find the new Branding & Templates section and how to request access if needed.
