Refactor this project to support a multi-site architecture with centralized content management, SEO optimization, and institutional configuration per brand.

General Requirements:
Preserve all existing content from the current NESS website (ness.com.br) — the content must be migrated into the new structure (inside /site/ness), not lost.

Support and isolate content for three brands:

ness.com.br

trustness.com.br

forense.io

Directory Structure:
/site/ness → homepage and content for NESS

/site/trustness → homepage and content for Trustness

/site/forense → homepage and content for forense.io

/admin → central CMS interface

/api/vagas → job listing API with site filter

/api/noticias → blog/news API with site filter

/api/landing → landing page API with slug and site filter

/api/config → endpoint to expose each site's metadata (see below)

CMS Features (/admin):
Manage content types:

Vagas (job listings)

Notícias (blog/news posts)

Landing pages (title, slug, meta, sections, CTA)

Manage institutional configuration per site:

Privacy policy and terms of use (editable text or markdown)

Social media URLs (LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.)

Contact email or recipient per site (for contact forms)

Each content item and config block must include assignment to one or more sites (ness, trustness, forense)

Provide simple preview and status (published/draft) control

SEO Requirements:
Support per-page metadata: <title>, <meta description>, canonical URL

Static-like, SEO-friendly routes for each site:

/trustness/blog/lgpd-guide

/forense/lp/emergency-response

/ness/lp/cloud-security

OpenGraph image and metadata per content item

Final Output:
Routes for each website:

/site/ness

/site/trustness

/site/forense

CMS panel with CRUD for content and settings

APIs to serve structured content per site

Content from the current NESS site is migrated and available under /site/ness

All sites must share a unified design system but allow for distinct identity (logo, palette, voice). The CMS must act as the control center for both content and brand-level configuration.
